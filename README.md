# CCFuse

CCFuse is a tool that lets you mount ComputerCraft computer filesystems locally using websockets and FUSE. It's still very much in alpha and there ARE bugs!

To try it out, you will need to run the host on your real computer, and then run the client on the CC computer, passing the appropriate URI as the only argument. If all goes well, they will connect, and you will have access to the CC filesystem.
